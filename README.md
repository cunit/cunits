# c-unit Repository

This is where we keep all those recipes we like
to chew on so much!

The main project is here [c-unit](https://github.com/cxxpods/cxxpods)

Most recipes are really simple and straight forward,
however some of the recipes have magic sugar
capsules that come with them .... for *FREE*

# An example of a sugary recipse

[Protobuf also has tools available](protobuf/README.md)

Checkout any of the recipes in this repo.  Then create a local repo as described
in the main doc, test it and issue a pull request - or - keep it in your own repo.
